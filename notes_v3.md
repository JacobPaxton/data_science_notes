# <center><strong>Data Science Notes, v3</strong></center>

## Why Version 3?
```
I really like notes_v2.md.
I designed it to pare down reference material into bite-size takeaways.
The idea was simple and elegant, and for that purpose, it worked decently well.

After a year of working with it, I've realized it's not actually that great.

For one, sections like "Pandas" splatter random code everywhere.
- There's no incentive to crawl through random code for something useful
- I know what all my listed Pandas methods do; I only (rarely) need their syntax
- If I need to look up syntax, I just use Shift+TAB in notebooks...

Other sections like "Databases" just explain overall concepts...
- Simplifying concepts risks over-simplification, making the explanation useless
- These notes were never meant for giant blocks of explanation!!

The info I actually need nowadays doesn't fit the structure of notes_v2.md...
- I don't need one-off code snippets for ex: training a regression model.
- I need to ex: execute regression successfully and efficiently, from scratch
- I also need to be able to talk to advanced ex: regression topics

In short: the whole of notes_v2.md needs a rewrite, methinks.

The plan is simple: focus on goals and challenges, and the options for success.
Restructure the notes to facilitate additions, not restrict them.

To be successful, I need to make sure my goals and challenges are well-selected.
