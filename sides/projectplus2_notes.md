# Discovery
- Discovery is the first phase
- determine whether project is worthwhile
- business case: help execs/stakeholders determine benefits/rewards of a project
    * Business need / justification
The Discovery/Concept Preparation phase is the first phase in in the project management life cycle. The purpose of this phase is to determine whether the project is worthwhile. This is where a business case is created. The business case  is a written document or report that helps executive management and key stakeholders determine the benefits and rewards of the project. It documents the business need or justification for the project and will often include high-  level details about estimated budgets and timelines for completing the project. We will talk more in depth about the business case later in this chapter. The Discovery phase also examines several elements that could help speed up the execution of the project. These activities may include working with prequalified vendors, working with predetermined clients, taking advantage of preexisting contracts, and utilizing financial concepts.

Documents:
- Business Case: Justification for the project

The Discovery/Concept Preparation phase is the first phase in the project management life cycle. This phase entails preparing a business case to determine the merits of the project. You’ll also examine existing contracts, vendors, and clients to help prepare future project documents, and/or to kick-  start the work of the project. Before we dive into the business case specifics, let’s cover some of the needs and demands that bring about projects.

# Initiation
Initiation is the formal authorization for a new project to begin or for an existing project to continue into the next phase. The Initiating  phase includes all the activities that lead up to the final authorization to begin the project. This process can be formal or informal, depending on the organization. 

The key activities in the Initiating phase according to the CompTIA Project+ objectives are as follows:
- Creating the preliminary scope statement 
- Creating the project charter 
- Identifying and assessing stakeholders 
- Developing a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) 
- Establishing accepted communication channels 
- Developing a records management plan 
- Defining access requirements 
- Reviewing existing artifacts 
- Determining solution design 
- Conducting the project kickoff

Documents:
- Preliminary scope statement: Project objectives are defined; business problem  the project will address is stated.
- Project charter: Authorizes the project to begin
- Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM): Defines stakeholder responsibilities. Incorporates the use of a RACI chart.

# Planning
- In the Planning phase, the project goals, objectives, and deliverables are refined and broken down into manageable units of work. Project managers create time and cost estimates and determine resource requirements for each activity. Planning involves several other critical areas of project management, such as communication, risk, human resources, quality, and procurement. 

Some of the key activities in the Planning process group are as follows: 
- Develop a detailed project scope statement 
- Develop a project schedule Determine budget considerations 
- Develop a quality assurance plan 
- Develop a communication plan 
- Assess and assign project resources 
- Perform an initial risk assessment 
- Assess the resource pool and assign project resources 
- Develop a project management plan 
- Train project team members 
- Define units of work 
- Develop a transition plan/release plan 

The Planning phase is unquestionably one of the most critical elements of managing a project. It’s possible that a project manager will spend as much time planning the project as performing the work of the project (sometimes more). 

The Planning phase contains many processes that all generally lead to the creation of plans or documents that are used throughout the project to ensure that goals of the project are being met. Table 1.1 shows many of the documents that CompTIA highlights in their objectives along with their purpose and the phase where they are typically produced. You will learn about each of the project management documents shown here, and more, throughout the remainder of the book.

Documents:
- Communication plan: Documents the types of information needs the  stakeholders have, when the information should be distributed, and how the information will be delivered.
- Project Schedule: Determines the start and finish dates for project activities, assigns resources to the activities
- Scope statement: Documents the product description, key deliverables, success and acceptance criteria, key performance indicators, exclusions, assumptions, and constraints
- Project management plan: Consists of all the project planning documents such as charter, scope statement, schedule, and more.


# Execution
The Executing  phase is where the work of the project is performed and monitored for adherence to the project management plan. This includes coordinating all the project members and project resources assigned to the project, reporting on status, updating project documents, managing change, and more.

The key activities in the Executing process are as follows: 
- Producing and verifying deliverables 
- Implementing change management 
- Managing vendors 
- Tracking and reporting project results 
- Updating project elements such as budget, risk, and timelines 
- Managing conflict 
- Monitoring the risks and issues log 
- Performing quality assurance/governance activities such as coordinating phase gate reviews 
- Monitoring the budget 
- Conducting project meetings and updates 

Deliverables are produced and verified during this process. If they do not conform to expectations, change requests are created or corrective actions are taken to ensure the deliverables adhere to specifications.

Resource management is important during the Executing processes. You’ll build the project team during this process, make certain resources are utilized appropriately, and perform team building activities. This process also includes working with vendors and contractors who are external to the organization.

Documents
- Issue log: A list of issues, containing list numbers, descriptions, and owners.
- Change log: Describes change requests and their disposition for the project.
- Risk register: A list of risks and their descriptions
- Status report: A report to stakeholders on the status of the project deliverables, schedule, risks, issues, and more.
- Dashboard information: An electronic reporting tool that lets users choose elements of the project to monitor project health and status.
- Meeting agenda / meeting minutes: Meeting agendas describe the items to be discussed and addressed at upcoming meetings, and minutes recap what was discussed and the decisions made  at the meeting.

# Closing
The primary purpose of the Closing phase is to validate deliverables and document the formal acceptance of the project work. Once that’s complete, a handoff occurs whereby the completed product or result of the project is turned over to the organization for ongoing maintenance and support. The Closing phase includes validating deliverables, signing off on the project, archiving project documents, handing off the product to the organization, releasing project team members, and reviewing lessons learned.

The key activities in the Closing process are as follows: 
- Validating deliverables 
- Closing contracts 
- Removing access 
- Releasing resources 
- Holding the project closure meeting 
- Writing the project closeout report 
- Obtaining feedback and lesson learned 
- Project sign-off 
- Handing off the product to the organization 
- Evaluating the project 
- Archiving project documents 
- Rewards and celebration 

Closing is the phase that is most often skipped in project management. Although some of these activities may seem fairly straightforward, several elements of this process group deserve close attention, and we will cover them in Chapter 10, “Managing Quality and  Closing Out the Project.”

## Chapter 5
### CH5 Be Able To
- Know how to define and create a work breakdown structure. The WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchy that describes the work required to complete the project. The WBS is a multilevel diagram that starts with the project, includes the major deliverables, and decomposes the major deliverables into smaller units of work to the point where time and cost estimates can be provided and resources assigned.
- Understand the levels in a WBS. The highest level of the WBS is the project name. The major deliverables, project phases, or subprojects make up the next level. The number of levels in a WBS will vary by project; however, the lowest level of the WBS is a work package.
- Describe a WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary describes each of the deliverables and their components and includes a code of accounts identifier, estimates, resources, criteria for acceptance, and any other information that helps clarify the deliverables.
- Know the difference between analogous estimating and bottom-up estimating. Analogous estimating is a top-down technique that uses expert judgment and historical information. Bottom-up estimating performs estimates for each work item and rolls them up to a total.
- Describe the task sequencing process. Sequencing is the process of identifying dependency relationships between the project activities and scheduling activities in the proper order.
- Name the two major relationships between dependent tasks. A predecessor is a task that exists on a path with another task and occurs before the task in question. A successor is a task that exists on a common path with another task and occurs after the task in question.
- Name the four types of logical relationships. The four types of logical relationships are finish-to-start, start-to-start, start-to-finish, and finish-to-finish.
- Know and understand the three most commonly used techniques to estimate activity duration. Expert judgment relies on the knowledge of someone familiar with the tasks. Analogous or top-down estimating bases the estimate on similar activities from a previous project. Parametric estimates are quantitatively-based estimates that typically calculate the rate times the quantity.
- Be able to calculate the critical path. The critical path includes the activities with durations that add up to the longest path of the project schedule network diagram. This path controls the finish date of the project. Any delay to a critical path task will delay the completion date of the project.
- Be able to define a critical path task. A critical path task is a project activity with zero or negative float.
- Define the purpose of CPM. CPM calculates the longest full path in the project. This path controls the finish date of the project. Any delay to a critical path task will delay the completion date of the project.
- Explain a network diagram. A network diagram is used to depict project activities and the interrelationships and dependencies among these activities.
- Name three common ways project schedules are displayed. Project schedules are typically displayed as milestone charts, PERT network diagrams, or Gantt charts; a Gantt chart is a type of bar chart.
- Be able to describe the difference between resource leveling and resource smoothing. Resource leveling can change the critical path and project end date. Resource smoothing does not change the critical path or project end date.
- Be familiar with the duration compression techniques. The duration compression techniques are crashing and fast tracking.
- Understand the estimating techniques for an agile project. Expert judgment is used most frequently on agile projects, but other techniques such as parametric estimating or bottom-up estimating will also work.
- Understand how to determine activity durations for an agile project. Activity durations can be calculated using the number of iterations needed to complete the work, using the number of story points needed to complete the work, or using average velocity to determine how many story points can be completed in each iteration.
- Be able to describe a Kanban board and a Scrum board and the difference between them. Kanban boards and Scrum boards are visual displays of the work of the project. Kanban uses cards or tasks, and Scrum uses tasks. Tasks are added to the first column, usually the backlog or user story column, and then broken down into tasks and pulled into the remaining columns as the work finishes. Kanban boards and their work are capacity-bound. The work is progressive and continuous. There isn't a start and stop date. Scrum boards are time-bound and display the work of the sprint.

### CH6 Be Able To
- Name the three types of organizational structures. The three types of organizational structures are functional, matrix, and projectized structures. Matrix organizations may be structured as a strong matrix, weak matrix, or balanced matrix organization.
- Understand the definition of resources. Resources can be human resources or physical resources. They are used to complete the work of the project. Resources include human, physical, capital, shared resources, dedicated resources, low-quality resources, internal resources, external resources, benched resources, and remote resources.
- Define resource allocation. Resource allocation is identifying resource availability and skills sets and assigning them to project tasks.
- Define resource overallocation and resource shortage. Resource overallocation occurs when resources are assigned too many tasks within a given time frame. Resource shortage occurs when there are not enough resources with the required skills or abilities to complete the tasks.
- Define interproject dependencies and interproject resource contention. Interproject dependencies occur when one project must complete its deliverables before another project can begin. Interproject resource contention occurs when resources are assigned to more than one project, resulting in timing and availability conflict.
- Describe a RACI chart and define the acronym. This is a matrix-based chart that shows the resource role and responsibility level for the work product. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed.
- Name the five stages of team development. They are forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning.
- Describe team building and trust building. Team building consists of activities that help diverse groups of people work together in an efficient and effective manner. Trust building involves building trust with the project manager and among team members. This takes time and is accomplished by being true to your word and having the team's best interests at heart.
- Name the conflict-resolution techniques and the technique that is best for project man-agers. The techniques are smoothing, forcing, compromising, collaborating, and avoiding.
- Project managers should use the collaborating technique. State the purpose of a project kickoff meeting. The project kickoff meeting is a way to formally introduce all project team members, to review the goals and the deliverables for the project, to discuss roles and responsibilities, and to review stakeholder expectations.
- Be able to name the types of contracts. The contract types include fixed-price, cost-reimbursable, and time and materials.
- Be able to name the types of vendor-centric documents. The types of vendor documents include nondisclosure agreements, cease-and-desist letters, letters of intent, statements of work, memoranda of understanding, service level agreements, purchase orders, maintenance agreements, and warranties.
- Be able to name the type of contract that's best for an agile project. A master service agreement (MSA) is the best type of contract to use for an agile project. Agile projects involve frequent, small deliveries, and an MSA allows you to add work to the contract via an appendix without having to rewrite the contract.

- Describe data classification. Data classification is a way to classify data based on its sensi-tivity, type, and value to the organization.
- Be able to define need-to-know basis. Need-to-know concerns relaying the least amount of information needed with only those who have a need-to-know.
- Know the difference between analogous, parametric, and bottom-up estimating tech-niques. Analogous, or top-down, estimates use expert judgment and historical data to provide a high-level estimate for the entire project, a phase of the project, or a deliverable. Parametric estimates use a mathematical model to create the estimates. The bottom-up method starts at the lowest level of the WBS and calculates the cost of each item within the work packages to obtain a total cost for the project or deliverable.
- Name the two discretionary funding allocations a project may receive. The two types of discretionary funding are a contingency reserve and a management reserve. Contingency reserves are monies set aside to cover the cost of possible adverse events and are used at the discretion of the project manager. Management reserves are set aside by upper management and are used to cover future situations that can't be predicted during project planning.
- Explain the purpose of a cost baseline. The cost baseline is the total approved, expected cost for the project. It's used throughout the project life cycle to monitor the performance of the project budget throughout the project.
- Explain the risk identification process. Risk identification is the process of identifying and documenting the potential risk events that may occur on the project.
- Explain the purpose of risk analysis. Risk analysis evaluates the severity of the impact to the project and the probability that the risk will actually occur.
- Be able to name the four risk analysis techniques. Impact analysis, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, and situational/scenario analysis.
- Explain Monte Carlo analysis. Monte Carlo analysis is a simulation technique that uses multiple inputs, usually related to cost and schedule, to estimate potential outcomes for each of the inputs used in the model. This is a "what if"-based analysis that is performed multiple times to determine potential outcomes.
- Be able to name at least four situational/scenario-based risks. They are new projects, new management, regulatory environment changes, digital transformation, infrastructure end-of-life, merger and acquisition, reorganization, and cybersecurity events.
- Name the negative risk response strategies. The negative risk response strategies are avoid, transfer, mitigate, and accept.
- Name the positive risk response strategies. The positive risk response strategies are exploit, share, enhance, and accept.
- Explain the purpose of risk response planning. Risk response planning is the process of reviewing the list of potential risks impacting the project to determine what, if any, action should be taken and then documenting it in a response plan.
