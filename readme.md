# Overview
This repository contains most of my working knowledge in multiple domains, including data science, frontend development, backend development, computer technician, network technician, and cybersecurity.

## History
The repo started with Codeup's data science program; as the program progressed, I rapidly pressed my takeaways into the now-defunct `ds_notes.md`, which I stopped editing on the last day of the Codeup program.

After Codeup, I moved to `notes_v2.md`, where I cleaned up `ds_notes.md` for organization and for revisiting topics I didn't cover clearly in the first go.

When I joined Booz Allen, I was tasked with assisting in a priority frontend development project. I basically self-taught front end development and shoved what I learned into `frontend_notes.md`. Some of those lessons got shoved into `notes_v2.md`, too.

During that development, I also tried to get ahead of my team's cyber domain support by creating `cyber_notes.md` and self-teaching cybersecurity. That effort didn't go far, I was way too busy for that low-priority effort.

After that priority project was complete, I found the time to enroll in Western Governor's University to pursue a bachelor's degree in Data Management/Data Analytics (funded by Booz Allen's tuition repayment program, FlexEd). Through WGU, I've learned a lot more theory than implementation; of note, I've added substantially to `notes_v2.md`, which now also contains data structures, advanced SQL, and C++ knowledge. I will revisit those sections after I've graduated from WGU too, in the same spirit of revisiting `ds_notes.md` after I graduated from Codeup.

## Future
I'm currently trying to wrap up that degree. The degree made me go through CompTIA's A+ and Net+ certifications, and I'm currently working through Project+ for the same reason. I did not keep clean notes for those, instead, I crammed everything and shoved the mess into the `sides` folder in this repo. I have some basic data analysis coursework and an Oracle database class left before I graduate.

After I graduate, I'll take time to rewrite a lot of the notes I've written so far. I've already begun trying to fit my notes into the 80-character-width rule, and my goal is to take everything I've written and fit it in that format. I also want to revisit a lot of concepts that I was forced to learn in an arbitrary way (rather than a useful way).

That rewrite may be fairly slow. I do have a personal life that I need to attend to after nearly a decade of neglect. But I really can't help myself, I love learning and I love taking notes. I feel like I'm stealing information from the world, making it into something much more clear and concise than the original, and storing it away permanently. I don't know how to explain it, but I love writing notes to this repo.

Eventually I intend on pursuing a master's degree in this field. If I graduate on time, I could start my master's program this spring/summer. I might take time off from study or I might dive straight into the master's program- really not sure at this point. Master's study will mean I'll have plenty more to shove into this repo; I don't see any other method of learning that matches the effectiveness and availability of sharpening course material manually. These notes files have also proven extremely valuable on the job; I reference them nearly every day (less as I go on).

## Conclusion
Feel free to "steal" from this repo, just as I've "stolen" from sources all over the Internet and from mentors in my personal/professional life over the past two years. I know I'll stop adding to it someday, but that day is not today...
