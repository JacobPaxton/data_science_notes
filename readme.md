# Overview
This repository contains most of my working knowledge in multiple domains, including data science, frontend development, backend development, computer technician, network technician, and cybersecurity.

## History
The repo started with Codeup's data science program; as the program progressed, I rapidly pressed my takeaways into the now-defunct `ds_notes.md`, which I stopped editing on the last day of the Codeup program.

After Codeup, I moved to `notes_v2.md`, where I rewrote `ds_notes.md` to be cleaner and richer.

When I joined Booz Allen, I was tasked with assisting in a priority frontend development project. I basically self-taught front end development and shoved what I learned into `frontend_notes.md`. Some of those lessons got shoved into `notes_v2.md`, too.

After that priority project was complete, I started my bachelor's program in data with WGU. I finished my degree in one term (6 months!!) and I put the notes from that sprint into `notes_v2.md` and other files in the `sides` folder. 

After completing my bachelor's program, I took the hastily-compiled `notes_v2.md` and reorganized it into the much-cleaner `notes_v3.md`.

Just days after I completed the move to `notes_v3.md`, I started my master's program in data with WGU. Throughout the program, I expanded the material in `notes_v3.md`, with the idea being that it would serve as a valuable reference for upcoming projects.

After completing my master's program, I shifted my focus for several months to delivering a big project at work. When I delivered that project, I started looking at my notes again, and realized that I should shift to a new notes approach in `notes_v4.md`.

## notes_v4.md
The problem with `notes_v3.md` is that its design is outdated. 

`notes_v4.md` focuses on **theory** and **new technologies**, because I no longer need static examples for fast implementation. 

### Solving fast implementation
Fast implementation- the focus of `notes_v3.md`- was solved in the past few months by ChatGPT-4o. For example, I just went to chatgpt.com and entered this prompt: "build and train a simple OLS regressor in python", which provided a fully-functional code example that I copy-pasted into a Jupyter notebook and ran without errors. The code didn't include a residual plot, so I replied with this prompt: "add a visualization for residuals so I can check for heteroscedasticity", which added a fully-working code block to visualize residuals. This is incredibly useful!

To do fast implementation effectively, I need to know how the process works in theory, and, the technologies that can put implementation to that theory. This is where `notes_v4.md` comes into play.

### A renewed focus on theory
Fast implementation via ChatGPT-4o is awesome, but it requires comprehension of theory. If I wasn't trained in regression modeling, I might not think to expand the above example for a residual plot at all (or even to use regression in the first place). Maybe I could (naively) prompt ChatGPT to provide additional evaluation metrics and luck out with a residuals/heteroscedasticity check, but *ensuring* those expanded outcomes requires a good handle of theory to guide ChatGPT's implementation. And, where ChatGPT comes up short, I can intervene with my experience, source documentation, and research papers.

Comprehension of theory is extremely important in professional scenarios, where you must be able to communicate approaches and considerations in real time with technical and non-technical audiences. After working in a data-focused enterprise for three years and serving as a Site Lead for two years, most of my time is spent advising approaches, where my knowledge of theory has reoriented and salvaged several dozen projects that had underperformant or misdirected implementation. Theory is therefore a force multiplier in organizations that can implement solutions when given proper design and strategy.

Moving to `notes_v4.md` is to admit this shift in the developmental landscape and adapt to it by focusing on theory. With this new approach, I can spend my time much more wisely.

### Falling in love with technology again
Escaping (some) implementation, and shifting my focus to theory, will practically require investigation into bleeding-edge technologies and methodologies! I've been stuck in an older Python loop because I'm proficient in it and I'm able to solve most business problems with it. I've largely been doing this by hand because I've been trained to do it that way; unfortunately, the manual implementation of old approaches was eroding my love for this career field, because I was stuck in stasis watching the wider realm of technology leap forward and advance! I want to learn those technologies and use them myself!

With the adjusted focus on theory in `notes_v4.md` and the ability to call upon ChatGPT-4o for fast implementation, I can consider other technologies and quickly spin up theory-informed, functional solutions in practically any framework. In practice, this means I'm spending my time much more effectively, and as a result, this allows me to keep up with all of the cool developments happening in the tech world! I can quickly pick up other technologies or methodologies out of sheer curiosity, yet still follow the informed larger strategy of theory.

Moving to `notes_v4.md` will inspire me to research new technologies again. This is a pretty big motivation boost for me after feeling burned out for the past year or two.

### In summary...
`notes_v4.md` will combine theory and new technologies, while ditching code focus, because I can use ChatGPT-4o for fast-yet-informed implementation on any platform. Now I can spend my time on my passion, which is the exploration into new terrain and new methodologies!

## Conclusion
Feel free to "steal" from this repo, just as I've "stolen" from sources all over the Internet and from mentors in my personal/professional life over the past three years. I know I'll stop adding to it someday, but that day is not today...
