# Overview
This repository contains most of my working knowledge in multiple domains, including data science, frontend development, backend development, computer technician, network technician, and cybersecurity.

## History
The repo started with Codeup's data science program; as the program progressed, I rapidly pressed my takeaways into the now-defunct `ds_notes.md`, which I stopped editing on the last day of the Codeup program.

After Codeup, I moved to `notes_v2.md`, where I rewrote `ds_notes.md` to be cleaner and richer.

When I joined Booz Allen, I was tasked with assisting in a priority frontend development project. I basically self-taught front end development and shoved what I learned into `frontend_notes.md`. Some of those lessons got shoved into `notes_v2.md`, too.

After that priority project was complete, I started my bachelor's degree in data with WGU. I finished my degree in one term (6 months!!) and I put the notes from that sprint into `notes_v2.md` and other files in the `sides` folder. 

After completing my bachelor's degree, I started writing `notes_v3.md`. I had the same requirements that I had after completing the Codeup DS program; `notes_v2.md` was a mess, and there was a lot to gain from reworking it and adding to it.

After moving all notes from `notes_v2.md` to `notes_v3.md`, I immediately started my master's degree in data with WGU, I was promoted to Site Lead, I dove into cutting-edge work processes + taught them, and I moved to a new place. I was busy! And I slowed down to accomodate everything.

I'm halfway through my master's degree; I've figured out how to pace my new workload; and I've settled in to my new place. I'm taking this opportunity to compile everything I've encountered over the past 6 months into `notes_v3.md` and look into new things.

## notes_v3.md
I noticed some serious flaws in `notes_v2.md` after I basically stopped using it. The original intention was to build an excellent and simple reference sheet for code. This ballooned with theory (taught by WGU), and the golden reference material was buried in over-explanation and already-memorized code. The reference approach fundamentally invites this kind of stagnation (just keep adding!!), and it's time to change the approach with `notes_v3.md`.

`notes_v3.md` focuses on achieving goals rather than serving as a reference tool.

If I need to accomplish a data goal, I should be able to pull a working, full sample from `notes_v3.md` and make small edits to achieve the goal. This approach allows extremely fast implementation and limits duplicate effort. Additionally, I can use the opportunity from implementation to update the sample; I can fix incompatibility or improve the sample's functionality or coverage. 

I need to be super careful that I don't start spamming code snippets back into this file. That will be the death of this file just like it killed `notes_v2.md`; being organized and specific is the key to making a great notes file.

## Conclusion
Feel free to "steal" from this repo, just as I've "stolen" from sources all over the Internet and from mentors in my personal/professional life over the past two years. I know I'll stop adding to it someday, but that day is not today...
